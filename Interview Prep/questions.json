        "answer": "As with many questions, the best answer here starts with a simple definition (when used inside an ObservableObject an @Published property will automatically send out change notifications when its value changes), then diving into a practical example. So, you might say that a class you're using in SwiftUI has an array of todo list items, and when that array changes the UI should update – a simple, real-world use for @Published.",

When it comes to a practical example, almost any kind of value-type SwiftUI binding is good, such as storing text in a TextField.",

        "answer": "Using init() and onAppear() both let us run some code early in a view's lifecycle, however it's important to understand the difference between them.\n\nSwiftUI creates all its view structs immediately, even creating destination views for navigation links, which means that initializers are run immediately and that's probably not something you want. In comparison, code placed in an onAppear() modifier is called only when the view is shown for the first time, so it's the right place to do complex work.",

        "answer": "I would recommend you start by making the similarities and differences clear, then sum up by answering the question directly. So, you would say that both of these property wrappers monitor an observable object for changes, and refresh SwiftUI views when changes happen. However, @StateObject is used when you create an object for the first time and want to retain ownership of it, whereas @ObservedObject is used in other places where you pass the object and does not retain ownership.",

It's also worth mentioning how child view controllers can also make our code more reusable, because the child can be used in other parent view controllers.",
